    <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The Western New York Chapter encompasses a region that includes Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Rochester, as well as the rural area in between. Historically, the urban areas were home to large industrial plants while the rural areas were and still are in large part agricultural. </p>
        <p> Our group of concerned and dedicated citizens are passionate in their defense of the planet.  The members come with a variety of experiences in government, education, medical, technological and volunteer backgrounds. Our chapter members hope to collaborate with regional partners in moving the region further to a green economy, protecting the waterways, rebuilding wetlands, advocating for environmental protections and educating communities about environmental issues. </p>
        <h2 id="background">Background and Context</h2>
            <h3>The Western New York Chapter</h3>
                <p>The Western New York Chapter was formed in 2020 to address the unique environmental concerns of the Great Lakes/Rust Belt cities of Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and Rochester and their suburbs and also in the rural areas in between. Our area has a particular sensitivity to historic toxic waste that began to occur before noticeable climate change. We have racially and ethnically diverse populations in both urban and rural communities who have suffered environmental injustices. We acknowledge that we are speaking from the traditional lands of the Seneca Nation, the keepers of the Western Door of the Haudenosaunee Longhouse, and we pay respect to their elders, who are caring for the land so it will thrive according to their original instructions. </p>
            <h3> The Climate Reality Project</h3>

        <h2 id="leadership">Leadership Team</h2>
            <p>The Chapter is organized as a 5-member Leadership Committee headed by a Chapter Chair, with 18 Chapter members. Of these, 10 are trained Climate Reality Leaders and 8 are public members, but look forward to being trained this year.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter Chair: Lynn Saxton</li>
            <li>Leadership Committee: Sandra Ebert, Nicole Morris-McLaughlin, Jennifer Fendya, and Julie Almond</li>
