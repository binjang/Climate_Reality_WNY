# Organization Website for "Climate Reality Western New York Chapter"

A group project for web design class where we were assigned to an actual client to build their website. 
All of the codes were written by me and my teammate without any outside help or sources. 
We worked with Climate Reality Western New York Chapter to build their organizational website. 
My job in the group was to build the "about.html", "carousel.js", and "hamburger.js" file, and I also worked on some of the CSS propertie, specifically implementing the fonts required by the organizational guideline and orgazing the media queries and the overall alignment (spacing) of pages. We got 99/100 points for the grades. 
The files had been slightly modified by me after the submission in class (bug fixes).
